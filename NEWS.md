## Needed
Below is a list of items that we are looking for outside help for. If you are able to help in any way please contact us info@TrakHound.org.

- A Linux Mono implementation for TrakHound-Server-Core that is simply capable of running the server. We are looking to be able to distribute the Server application on Linux systems which would help broaden the ways TrakHound can be integrated into already existing systems.
- A web based Device Manager that is capable of at least enabling/disabling devices and ability to restart server.
- A web based Table Manager that is capable of viewing raw data for each device's database.
