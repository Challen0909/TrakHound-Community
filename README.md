##About
TrakHound is an Open Source MDC software package designed to retrieve and store data from CNC and other PLC driven industrial equipment. Data is retrieved using <a href="http://mtconnect.org">MTConnectÂ®</a>, processed, and then stored in a database. 

Machine Data Collection (MDC) software is used to evaluate shop productivity and identify problem areas. TrakHound provides free dashboards to view current machine status and basic production data so shop supervisors can quickly see which machines are operating normally and which ones are in need of attention. This transparency allows for a smoother workflow through your shop with reduced downtime. 

Setup is easy using the built in Device Manager page. Devices can be added from our Device Catalog which contains preconfigured devices and all that is needed is to enter in the MTConnect Agent and database information. Users can also share their devices using the Device Catalog so each configuration can be improved upon by the community. The Device Manager has all of the tools to fully configure each device. Some pages are specific to the Server or Client applications so depending on which application the Device Manager is opened in, the options may vary.
