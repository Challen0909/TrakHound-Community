## News
**Update 7/29/16 - v1.0.0 Official Release** 

- **This repo was renamed 'TrakHound-Community' instead of just 'TrakHound'.** TrakHound Community is the new official name of the open source PC software package for the TrakHound platform. 
- **'TrakHound Client' was renamed to 'TrakHound Dashboard'** in order to better accomodate future client applications (reports, activity monitor, etc.).
- The directory structure and projects of this repo were changed to better organize projects and consolidate libraries and plugins into fewer projects (went from ~50 to 8 projects). Plugins are now contained in the TrakHound.NET project (the one exception is the TrakHound-Overview dashboard plugin). 
- **You may have noticed that we created separate repos for each project, well, that didn't work very well so we're going to not update those but leave them up for a few weeks in case anyone was linked to them.**
- All nuget packages were removed in favor of a 'lib' directory (some users had issues when downloading/cloning repo and nuget packages wouldn't update correctly).
- Part of project consolidation was to separate UI components from projects where the project could need to be run without any UI (TrakHound Server). This should make is easier compile for other platforms (such as using Mono for Linux).
- **We temporarily removed the MySQL database plugin to update it and we are moving the ability to write to a remote database to only be available with our TrakHound Standard version. We are trying to keep as much as we can free but this feature was chosen to be an upgrade. Please contact sales@trakhound.com for more information.**
- We are about to launch a new website (TrakHound.com) with updated Help documentation for setup, configuration, and development.
- **This is our first 'Official' release and we want to thank everyone that assisted us in our beta phase with contributions and feedback!** Hopefully we can continue to develop and improve this project into a reliable, customizable, and easy to use monitoring solution that can become the standard data collection app using MTConnect.
 

## Help Needed!

- We are working on our documenation and if anyone has any good screenshots of the TrakHound dashboards or other screens and would like to contribute then please send those to info@trakhound.com.


##About
TrakHound is an Open Source MDC software package designed to retrieve and store data from CNC and other PLC driven industrial equipment. Data is retrieved using <a href="http://mtconnect.org">MTConnectÂ®</a>, processed, and then stored in a database. 

Machine Data Collection (MDC) software is used to evaluate shop productivity and identify problem areas. TrakHound provides free dashboards to view current machine status and basic production data so shop supervisors can quickly see which machines are operating normally and which ones are in need of attention. This transparency allows for a smoother workflow through your shop with reduced downtime. 

Setup is easy using the built in Device Manager where a user can search their entire network for MTConnect compatible machines and then those machines get cross-referenced with our Device Catalog to find the best matched Device Configuration. Once matched, a list of machines on the network will be shown and the user can simply select which ones to monitor. Device Configurations are fully customizable by the user.

##How it Works

TrakHound works by reading data using the MTConnect communications protocol. This data is then processed and stored in a database. The default database is SQLite where data is stored on the PC that TrakHound is installed on. Other databases can be used for remote storage and currently MySQL and SQL Server are supported.

####Basic Setup
Below is a diagram showing how a basic setup works. This shows two machines communicating directly with one PC and all data is stored on that PC. This is a good starting point for most users and can be used in scenarios where only one user needs to view data.

####Standalone Server Setup
Below is a diagram showing how a standalone server setup works. This shows two machines communicating with a standalone server with TrakHound Server installed. The server then stores the data in a separate database that can be accessed by PC's on the network. Multiple PC's can then view data using TrakHound while reading directly from the database.
